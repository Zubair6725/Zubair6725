### check if the string is empty

-z is the option through which we can check if the string is empty

```bash
read -p “type something” str
if  [ -z  “str” ]; then
 echo "this is an empty string"
  exit
fi
echo "moving on "

```

### condition to check if a files EXISTS

```bash
read -p “type file name ” file
if  [ -e  “file” ]; then  #e=exists does not exist= ! eq
 echo "this $file exists "
  exit
fi
echo "does not exists "\
```

### condition to check if a file is directory

```bash
read -p “type file name ” file
if  [ -d  “file” ]; then  
 echo "this $file is directory "
  exit
fi
echo "is not a directory"\
```

### condition to check if a file is readable

```bash
read -p “type file name ” file
if  [ -r  “file” ]; then  ##-w writable
 echo "this $file is readable "
  exit
fi
echo "is not readable "\
```

### condition to check if a file is NOT EMPTY

```bash
read -p “type file name ” file
if  [ -S  “file” ]; then  #e=exists does not exist= ! eq
 echo "this $file is not empty which means data is in there "
  exit
else 
echo "this file is empty"

```
